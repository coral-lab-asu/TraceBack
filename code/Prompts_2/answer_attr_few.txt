Given a table and a few questions, find the groups of relevant (row, column) cells that are relevant to each phrase of the question, as well as the answer to the question. - Use 0-based indexing for rows and columns. - Include the cells that are necessary to reconstruct the <Original-Answer> and the question in <Questions> (also it's respective answer).

<Example-1>

Input :
<Relevant-Columns> : ["King","Start of Reign","End of Reign","Total Duration"]
<Table-Rows> : [["Devanshu","1901","1998","98 Years"],["Poojah","1999","2100","101"],["Rajat","2111","2211","100"]]

<Questions> :
1. What was the duration of King Poojah's reign?
2. What was the End of the Reign year of King Poojah?
3. Which king started his reign at the end of King Poojah's reign?

<Original-Answer> :
King Poojah reigned for 101 Years. The next king to reign afterward was King Rajat, who started his reign in 2111.

<Final Answer>
1. [(1,0),(1,3)]
2. [(1,0),(1,2)]
3. [(1,0),(2,0),(2,1)]

<Instructions>
1. For each question, output a single line with a list of (row, col) tuples; deduplicate and avoid unrelated cells.
2. Use 0-based indexing. Rows index the table body (header excluded); columns index the header.
3. Only use parentheses in the final per-question answer lines.

Now, give output for the following input.

Output Format (EXACT)
- There is exactly one question. Output exactly one line containing only a single list of tuples.
- The line must start with `[` and end with `]` and contain only integer pairs in parentheses.
- Do not output any other text, labels, bullets, or explanations.
- If no cells apply, output `[]` only.

Example:
[(3,2), (3,4)]
