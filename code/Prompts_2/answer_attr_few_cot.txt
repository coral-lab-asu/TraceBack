Given a table and a few questions, find the groups of relevant (row, column) cells that are relevant to each phrase of the question, as well as the answer to the question. - Use 0-based indexing for rows and columns. - Include the cells that are necessary to reconstruct the <Original-Answer> and the question in <Questions> (also it's respective answer).

<Example-1>

Input :
<Relevant-Columns> : ["King","Start of Reign","End of Reign","Total Duration"]
<Table-Rows> : [["Devanshu","1901","1998","98 Years"],["Poojah","1999","2100","101"],["Rajat","2111","2211","100"]]

<Questions> :
1. What was the duration of King Poojah's reign?
2. What was the End of the Reign year of King Poojah?
3. Which king started his reign at the end of King Poojah's reign?

<Original-Answer> :
King Poojah reigned for 101 Years. The next king to reign afterward was King Rajat, who started his reign in 2111.

<Final Answer>
1. [(1,0),(1,3)]
2. [(1,0),(1,2)]
3. [(1,0),(2,0),(2,1)]

Output Explanation:
- We include the subject row cell (1,0) for identifying “Poojah”, and the supporting cell (1,3) for “101 Years”.
- For Q2 we include (1,0) as the row identifier and (1,2) for the End of Reign.
- For Q3 we include (1,0) for Poojah’s row, (2,0) to identify “Rajat”, and (2,1) for his start year 2111.

<Instructions>
1. Briefly reason first in 1–3 short lines, but do not use any parentheses or tuple-like text in the reasoning.
2. Then output the final per-question answer lines. Only these lines may contain parentheses.
3. Use 0-based indexing. Rows index the table body (header excluded); columns index the header; deduplicate tuples and avoid unrelated cells.

Now, give output for the following input.

Output Format (EXACT)
- There is exactly one question. Output exactly one line containing only a single list of tuples.
- The line must start with `[` and end with `]` and contain only integer pairs in parentheses.
- Do not output any other text, labels, bullets, or explanations.
- If no cells apply, output `[]` only.

Example:
[(3,2), (3,4)]
