You are given:
- The original question and its final (ground-truth) answer.
- A pruned table (<Relevant-Columns> and <Table Rows>, header excluded).
- A list of sub-questions.
- A set of candidate evidence cells gathered from the sub-questions (optional).

Your task: output the final set of evidence cells (row, column) that justify the final answer.
Important:
- Include implicit evidence cells needed for the reasoning chain (e.g., filter conditions, intermediate values), even if they are not verbatim in the answer.
- Exclude irrelevant cells.

Indexing rules:
- Use 0-based indexing for BOTH rows and columns.
- Row indices refer to <Table Rows> (the pruned rows, header excluded).
- Column indices refer to <Relevant-Columns> (the ordered list provided).

Output format:
- Output a single line:
  <Final Cells>: [(row_index, col_index), (row_index, col_index), ...]
- If no evidence is found, output:
  <Final Cells>: []
- Do not output anything else.
