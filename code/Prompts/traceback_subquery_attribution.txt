You are given a pruned table (only the relevant columns and the relevant rows), the original Answer, plus a list of sub-questions.

Your task: for EACH sub-question, return the minimal set of table cells (row, column) needed to answer that sub-question, considering the context of the original Answer.
Include cells used for filtering/comparisons/calculations even if they are not explicitly mentioned in the final answer text.

Indexing rules:
- Use 0-based indexing for BOTH rows and columns.
- Row indices refer to <Table Rows> (the pruned rows, header excluded).
- Column indices refer to <Relevant-Columns> (the ordered list provided).

Output format:
- Return one line per sub-question, in the same order as given:
  <Cells>: [(row_index, col_index), (row_index, col_index), ...]
- If a sub-question has no evidence in the table, output:
  <Cells>: []
- Do not output anything other than these <Cells>: ... lines.
