Given a table and a few questions, find the groups of relevant (row, column) cells that are relevant to each phrase of the question, as well as the answer to the question. - Use 0-based indexing for rows and columns. - Include the cells that are necessary to reconstruct the <Original-Answer> and the question in <Questions> (also it's respective answer). 

<Example-1>

Input :
<Relevant-Columns> : ["King","Start of Reign","End of Reign","Total Duration"]
<Table-Rows> : [["Devanshu","1901","1998","98 Years"],["Poojah","1999","2100","101"],["Rajat","2111","2211","100"]]

<Questions> :
1. What was the duration of King Poojah's reign?
2. What was the End of the Reign year of King Poojah?
3. Which king started his reign at the end of King Poojah's reign?

<Original-Answer> :
King Poojah reigned for 101 Years. The next king to reign afterward was King Rajat, who started his reign in 2111.

<Final Answer>
1. [(1,0),(1,3)]
2. [(1,0),(1,2)]
3. [(1,0),(2,0),(2,1)]

Output Explanation:
The information about King Poojah (column 0) is given in 1st row (0-based indexing). The name of the King - Poojah - which is asked in question-1 can be found in column 0 (0-based indexing).
The duration of the King Poojah (column 0) can be found from the relevant column "Total Duration" (column 3)- 101 Years, which is also mentioned in the original answer.
To get the successor of King Poojah (column 0), we need to find the King whose start of the reign is right after the end of the reign of King Poojah - King Rajat (column 0) - who is also mentioned in the answer.
In the original answer, the start of the reign of King Rajat is also mentioned - 2111 - column 1.
</Example-1>

<Instructions>
1. Give the final answer (single line) in the format - a single list of tuples for each question as shown in <Final Answer>.
2. Use 0-based indexing for both rows and columns to give the final answer.
3. Don't miss any relevant cells.


Now, give output for the following input.
