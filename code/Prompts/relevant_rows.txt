Given a table schema and other table meta-data, question based on table and answer for the question, write a MySQL query
to retrieve all the relevant rows of the table, such that the answer to the given question can be generated from the
retrieved rows. Your focus should be to not eliminate any relevant rows from the table. Think step-by-step.

Important MySQL formatting rules:
- Use backticks (`...`) around table names and column names (identifiers), especially if they contain spaces or punctuation.
- Put ONLY the SQL inside the <SQL> ... </SQL> tags (do not add a leading colon after <SQL>).

<Example-1> : 

Input :
Table-Schema :
<Column Names>: ["King Name", "Start of the Reign", "End of the Reign", "Duration"]
<Table Title>: "Kings_Time_Duration_Info"
<Table-Rows> : [["Bhopal","Devanshu","1901","1998","98 Years"],["Chennai","Poojah","1999","2100","101"],["Ujjain","Rajat","2111","2211","100"]]

Question : "How long did king Poojah held the throne and who was his successor?"
Answer : "King Poojah held the throne for 101 years and King Rajat was his successor." 

Output :
<step-by-step reasoning>
1. In the question, the duration and the successor is asked for King Poojah.
2. In the answer, duration of King Poojah is mentioned along with the sucessor to King Poojah - King Rajat.
3. The SQL query will be such that it retrieves the row of King Poojah and all the rows that has the "Start of the Reign" >= 2100 ("End of the Reign" for King Poojah).
Final Answer : 
<SQL> CREATE TABLE Pooja_King AS SELECT * FROM `Kings_Time_Duration_Info` WHERE `King Name` = 'Poojah' OR CAST(`Start of the Reign` AS SIGNED) >= 2100; </SQL>
</Example-1>

<Instructions>
1. Follow the given format for the final answer. The final SQL query should be between <SQL> </SQL> tags.
2. Only write CREATE MySQL statements.
3. Give a SQL statement for MySQL.
4. The query giving the filtered table should cover all parts of the question and answer.

Now, give output for the following input.
